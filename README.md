The component "Contact.js" plays a crucial role in the application by handling the display of contact details. It receives contact information from the parent component, "App.js," through props. The received data includes details such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses.

In the user interface of "Contact.js," the contact information is presented in a scrollable view. This allows the user to easily navigate through a list of contacts, especially when there is a large number of contacts to display.

To enhance the user experience, a model is implemented in "Contact.js" to handle pop-ups. This allows for interactive and intuitive interactions with the contact information. For example, when the user selects a specific contact, a pop-up or modal can be displayed to provide more options or information related to that contact.

In addition, the "TouchableOpacity" component is utilized to enable the selection of particular contacts. This component adds a touchable and responsive behavior to the contact elements, allowing users to interact with them easily.

Moving on to "App.js," the "loadContacts" function is defined. This function is responsible for requesting permission from the user to access their contacts. If the user grants permission, the function proceeds to retrieve all the contacts from the device's contact list.

Once the contacts are successfully retrieved, the "loadContacts" function stores the contact data and updates the application's state. The state holds the data in a structured format, allowing other components, like "Contact.js," to access and display the contact information.

By implementing this flow and utilizing the mentioned components and functions, the application effectively loads and displays the contacts while providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
